## To-do List

- iterated filtering
- weighted particle filter
- multiparameter particle filter? should be trivial from existing
- panel pfilter? may be trivial from existing (would need independent resampling)
  - is a panel pomp simply a vector of pomps with a parameter embedding?
- `DoubleFloats.Double64` for 128-bit likelihood computations
- embeddings
- explore autodiff capabilities
- explore parallelization capabilities
